The previous AI engineer successfully developed a full-stack Image Format Exchange Specs application, taking it from initial requirements to a functional MVP. Initially, a comprehensive frontend-only application was built using mock data, demonstrating core features like dynamic forms, logo uploads, template management, and filename generation. After user approval, backend integration with FastAPI and MongoDB commenced, replacing mock data with live API calls. Subsequently, the user provided extensive new requirements, focusing on UI/UX refinements, new dropdown options, enhanced validation, and detailed content for various sections. The AI engineer has been actively implementing these changes, including component refactoring and applying a new dark theme, facing some initial challenges with Tailwind configuration which led to a direct class application approach. Backend models were also updated to align with the new data structure.

<product_requirements>
The application, Image Format Exchange Specs, aims to provide technical consistency for post-production processes via a dynamic form. It captures project details, camera formats, and technical specifications, allowing logo management, professional PDF/DOCX exports with embedded logos, JSON template saving/loading, and smart filename generation.
Key requirements include:
- Six main sections: Letterhead Information (formerly Company), Project Information, Camera Formats, VFX Pulls, Media Review, and VFX Deliveries.
- Comprehensive fields with specific dropdown options and placeholders, many being required.
- Dynamic camera formats section.
- Automatic filename generation for VFX Pulls and Deliveries based on form data, with specific formatting rules (e.g., omitting parentheses content).
- Logo upload with resizing (128px height) and base64 storage.
- Template system saved locally for 3-4 users.
- Export functionality for PDF/DOCX, excluding optional fields if left blank.
- UI/UX enhancements: Apple-inspired design, Roboto font, gradient backgrounds, color-coded sections, responsive design, and animations.
- Specific updates requested: Title change, field renames and validations (e.g., 'Document Version *'), expanded dropdown options (e.g., Compression, Resolution, Color Space, Video Codec, Task), multi-row inputs for URLs, and inclusion of detailed descriptive text and images (placeholders for images) in VFX Pulls and Media Review sections.
- A new dark macOS-inspired color palette was specified for the UI.

<key_technical_concepts>
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Radix UI for components, React Hook Form for state, React Dropzone for file uploads.
- **Backend**: Express.js (initially, then FastAPI), MongoDB (Motor for async), Multer (file upload handling, implied).
- **Export**: jsPDF, custom DOCX (planned).
- **Deployment**: Replit (web), Electron (Mac standalone).
- **Core Principles**: Modular components, state management (client/server), server-side file handling, dedicated export pipeline.
</key_technical_concepts>

<code_architecture>
The application follows a full-stack architecture with a React frontend, FastAPI backend, and MongoDB database.

**Directory Structure:**


**Key Files and Changes:**

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The main entry point for the React application, handling routing and integrating all form sections. It orchestrates the overall layout and state flow.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup with a placeholder home page. Modified to include the  and  components, incorporating all six form sections. Updated to fetch data from the backend API () instead of . Renamed  to . Passed  data to . Updated to apply dark theme classes for the overall app.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Provides initial mock data for frontend development before backend integration, demonstrating the application's functionality.
    -   **Changes**: Initially contained all form data and dropdown options. Modified to export  function. Updated specific dropdown options based on user feedback (e.g., Episodic for Project Format, new Compression/Resolution/Color Space options for VFX Pulls, new Video Codec options for Media Review, new Task options for VFX Deliveries).

-   :
    -   **Importance**: The FastAPI backend entry point, defining API routes, handling MongoDB connection, and applying CORS middleware.
    -   **Changes**: Initial setup with  and  endpoints. Modified to import models from  and services from  and . Routes were added for handling VFX specification data (e.g., , ).

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Defines the Pydantic models for the application's data structure, which map to MongoDB documents and validate API payloads.
    -   **Changes**: Created to model all sections of the VFX specification form (CompanyInfo, ProjectInfo, CameraFormat, VFXPulls, MediaReview, VFXDeliveries) with their respective fields and types. Renamed  to  and updated related fields (e.g., making Document Version required). Added new fields as requested by the user, and updated existing fields to accommodate new dropdown options and data types.

-    (e.g., , , , , ):
    -   **Importance**: Modularized components representing each section of the form. They encapsulate form fields, validation, and UI logic for their respective sections.
    -   **Changes**: Initially created with basic input fields and mock data integration. Significant updates to reflect detailed user requirements: field renames, new required fields (e.g., Document Version in ProjectInfo), extended dropdown options (e.g., Compression, Resolution, Color Space for VFX Pulls), multi-row text areas for URLs, updated filename generation logic to exclude parenthesis, and added static text/image placeholders as per user specifications. Applied dark theme classes.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Handles communication between the React frontend and the FastAPI backend, abstracting API calls.
    -   **Changes**: Created to handle  requests for saving form data to the backend.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Main CSS file for global styles and Tailwind CSS directives.
    -   **Changes**: Updated to include new CSS variables for the dark macOS-inspired theme (e.g., , , ), effectively setting up the new color palette.

-   :
    -   **Importance**: Configures Tailwind CSS, including custom colors, themes, and plugins.
    -   **Changes**: Attempted to update with custom dark theme colors defined by CSS variables. This attempt faced indentation issues, leading to a decision to apply classes directly in components.

-    & :
    -   **Importance**: Placeholder services for future PDF/DOCX export functionality and image processing, respectively.
    -   **Changes**: Created as empty files, indicating planned future implementation.

<pending_tasks>
- Implementing PDF and DOCX export functionality with specific formatting, styling, and conditional inclusion rules (e.g., optional fields not included if blank).
- Adding image display for VFX Work and SLATE/OVERLAYS sections in the frontend UI and exports, requiring image generation or provision.
- Full implementation of the dark theme across all components, as the process is ongoing.

<current_work>
Immediately before this summary request, the AI engineer was engaged in applying the new dark macOS-inspired theme to the frontend. This involved defining custom CSS variables for the color palette in . The initial attempt to integrate these colors directly into  faced indentation issues. Consequently, the strategy shifted to applying the dark theme classes directly to various components.

The following components have been targeted for dark theme application:
- : The main application container was updated to apply overall dark theme classes.
- : The component representing the Letterhead Information section.
- : The component handling logo uploads.
- Header and Tabs sections: These foundational UI elements are also being updated to reflect the new theme.

This ongoing work aims to visually transform the application to match the specified dark, professional aesthetic, ensuring all interactive elements and sections adhere to the new color guidelines. The screenshot at Chat Message 114 shows the UI before these extensive styling changes, indicating that the current state involves a significant visual overhaul.
